    "The performance for Naive Bayes is better than Decision Tree, both in terms of computational time and its ability to predict. Hence, we should choose Naive Bayes over Decision Tree. Consequently, we move on to compare Naive Bayes with Adaboost. Although Adaboost has a slightly better predictive ability than Naive Bayes, it is very small. Moreover, Adaboost consumes a lot more computational time compared to Naive Bayes and this implies that we need more computational power which costs more. In light of this, we should choose Naive Bayes as it provides comparable predictive capabilities while providing substantial cost savings relative to Adaboost, the next best model."

    "<br \\>We have decided to choose the Naive Bayes model due to its ability to best predict if a student is likely to graduate or otherwise at a reasonable cost. Moreover, the model can work with a small dataset of students, hence saving more data collection costs. With the benefits of the model in mind, we move on to explain how this model works in three steps. A minor flaw of this model is that it assumes the performance indicators of students are independent of one another, but in practice even if this assumption is violated the model has been known to work well too.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the model would look at all of the students' performance indicators such as health state, relationship status, absence rate and many others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it will learn how each performance indicator contribute to the probability if a student would graduate or otherwise. For example, if a student did not graduate, the student may have a high level of absence rate and the model would learn this probability, which may likely be high. But we know one indicator is not indicative of whether a student graduates or not, so we account for the probabilities of all of the student's performance indicators where each performance indicator contributes to the probability if a student would graduate or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, when we have new students' performance indicators, we can easily feed their performance indicators into the model and the model would predict, based on all of the performance indicators' probabilities, that a student is likely to graduate or otherwise."
